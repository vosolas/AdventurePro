# SpinShadow

**Private spinning game with encrypted outcomes**

SpinShadow is a privacy-preserving spinning game where bet amounts and spin results remain encrypted during gameplay. Built on Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine (FHEVM), the platform processes spins over encrypted bets, revealing only final outcomes while keeping individual bets and spin mechanics private.

---

## Game Concept

SpinShadow combines the excitement of spinning games with cryptographic privacy guarantees. Players place encrypted bets, spin encrypted wheels, and receive encrypted payoutsâ€”all while maintaining privacy from other players and game operators. Using Zama FHEVM, spin mechanics execute over encrypted data, ensuring fair play without exposing betting strategies or amounts.

**Unique Feature**: Homomorphic spin mechanics enable random outcomes computed over encrypted bets without revealing bet details until game completion.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Spinning Process

**Round Initiation:**
1. Player encrypts bet amount using FHE public key
2. Encrypted bet submitted to smart contract
3. Spin triggered with encrypted parameters
4. Game state initialized (encrypted)

**Spin Execution:**
1. Random outcome generated (cryptographically secure)
2. Outcome encrypted with FHE
3. Win/loss determined homomorphically:
   ```solidity
   ebool isWin = TFHE.eq(encryptedOutcome, encryptedWinCondition);
   ```
4. Payout calculated over encrypted bet:
   ```solidity
   euint64 payout = TFHE.mul(encryptedBet, encryptedMultiplier);
   ```

**Result Resolution:**
1. Encrypted outcome and payout computed
2. Results stored as encrypted ciphertexts
3. Threshold key holders decrypt final results
4. Payout distributed to winner
5. Bet amount returned to losers (if applicable)

## Betting System

### Encrypted Bet Submission

**Bet Structure:**
```solidity
struct EncryptedBet {
    euint64 amount;           // Encrypted bet amount
    euint32 spinNumber;      // Encrypted target number
    uint256 timestamp;        // Public timestamp
    address player;          // Public player address
}
```

**Submission Process:**
1. Player selects bet amount (plaintext, locally)
2. Player encrypts bet amount with FHE public key
3. Encrypted bet submitted to contract
4. Contract validates payment (plaintext validation)
5. Encrypted bet stored on-chain

### Homomorphic Payout Calculation

**Win Detection:**
```solidity
ebool isWinner = TFHE.eq(
    encryptedSpinResult,
    encryptedTargetNumber
);
```

**Payout Computation:**
```solidity
euint64 payout = TFHE.cmux(
    isWinner,
    TFHE.mul(encryptedBet, encryptedMultiplier),
    0
);
```

## FAQ

**Q: How private are my bets if they're on-chain?**  
A: Bets are encrypted with FHE before submission. Only encrypted ciphertexts are stored, and spin mechanics execute over encrypted data. Your bets remain private.

**Q: How do I know spins are fair?**  
A: Randomness is generated on-chain using verifiable random number generation. All operations are cryptographically provable, ensuring fairness.

**Q: Can game operators manipulate outcomes?**  
A: No. Outcomes are determined using encrypted operations that cannot be manipulated. Randomness source is verifiable, and all operations are provable.

**Q: What happens if I lose my private key?**  
A: Without your private key, you cannot decrypt your bet to verify outcomes. However, if you won, the payout is claimable by your address.
